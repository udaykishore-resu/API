# API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. 

It acts as a bridge between different systems, enabling them to exchange data and functionality without exposing their internal workings.

# Why do we need APIs?
APIs are essential for modern software development because they:
- Enable integration between different systems and services
- Promote modularity and reusability of code
- Allow for faster development and innovation
- Provide a standardized way of accessing data and functionality
